# Inspiration
We wanted to learn how to utilize the slatejs framework, so we came up with an idea to build a markdown to HTML editor using the framework.

# What it does
It allows a user to write in markdown and have a preview of your markdown in HTML.

# How we built it
We made use of the markdown-it package to convert the serialized slatejs object to HTML and also eslint-react for linting purpose.
