# Inspiration
We wanted to learn how to utilize the slatejs framework, so we came up with an idea to build a markdown to HTML editor using the framework.

# What it does
It allows a user to write in markdown and have a preview of your markdown in HTML.

# How we built it
We made use of the markdown-it package to convert the serialized slatejs object to HTML and also eslint-react for linting purpose.

# Challenges I ran into
We had challenges with deserializing markdown contents from GitHub and converting them to what slatejs can understand.

# Accomplishments that we are proud of
We are proud of the fact that we were able to serialize the slatejs object into HTML for live preview

# What We learned
We learnt how to use GitHub Oauth in an application, we also learnt how to use eslint for linting, slatejs for customizing your editor and React context for sharing state between components.

# What's next for mlhteam3
We plan to finally deserialize content from GitHub to a slatejs object. i.e we plan to extend this project to enable users to import whatever has been written here into one of their repositories.
